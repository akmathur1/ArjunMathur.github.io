I am an incoming Ph.D. student in EECS at MIT, interested in research at the intersection of machine learning and structural biology, specifically with generative modeling. Additionally, I continue to be excited by advances in single cell genomics and how graph representation learning can be utilized. My research is partially supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP).

Previously, I completed my B.S. in CS at Georgia Tech specializing in Machine Learning and Theory. I was incredibly fortunate to have been advised by Xiuwei Zhang (Georgia Tech), Jian Ma (CMU), Ruochi Zhang (Broad), and Bonnie Berger (MIT).
